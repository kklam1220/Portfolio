Story Synopsis (English)

On the vast grasslands, a tiny Stone Spirit sets out on a journey to discover who he truly is.

Every summer, the Stone Spirits gather to showcase their magical powers—fire, ice, flowers, and more. But the smallest among them has no idea what his own magic is, and leaves the festival feeling lost and uncertain. Encouraged by the Rose Stone Spirit and the words of the wise Basalt Elder, he travels to the Ancient Forest in search of the Mirror of Answers.

Along the way, he meets an energetic Squirrel obsessed with finding the world’s most delicious cookie, and a solitary Wolf whom they rescue from danger. Together, the unlikely trio crosses rivers, cliffs, and darkness, learning courage, patience, and trust.

When disaster strikes and the Squirrel and Wolf fall into a deep cavern, the little Stone Spirit must face his fears alone. In the darkness, he discovers a soft glow rising from within himself—his true magic. Guided by this new light, he finds his friends and finally reaches the Mirror of Answers. There, they each learn something important: the sweetness of sharing, the strength of believing in oneself, and the meaning of family.

The little Stone Spirit realizes he is a Light Stone Spirit—one who can bring hope to others. And though the journey has ended, a new adventure awaits just around the corner.
